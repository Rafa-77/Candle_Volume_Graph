Make a interactive candle and volumne graph in R

## Part 1 - Main.R


This project uses a linear database.
And a financial graph is made, where one can enter the information of an Excel file and obtain a candlestick graph reflecting the prices. 
Where if you hover over the graph, you will be able to see the price.

Also a volume graph. Where if you hover over the graph, you will be able to see the volume.

So that in the end I attach both graphs in one.

## Part 2 - Main2.R

The code from Main2.R does not take the data from an Excel file, it extracts it directly from Yahoo Finance.
We use the ticker "F" from 2019/01/01 to 2022/01/01.
This code cleans the data and groups it dayly, weekly, and monthly.
It also creates indicators such as:
- Simple Moving Averages
- Exponential Moving Averages
- Bolinger Bands
- Momentum
- Price Rate of Change
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- Relative Strenght Index

It first creates simple graph, where if you hover over the graph, you will be able to see the data of that particular period, including:
- Date
- Open price
- High Price
- Low price
- Close Price
And also at the bottom of the graph we can adjust the time lime.

</p>

Then it creates the volumne graph just like in Main.R

</p>

Finally it proceeds to create a graph for each one of the indicators and joins them all in a single graph.
Where also if you hover over hte graph you wil see the particular data, including that of the indicators.

## Part3 - Main3.R

In the last part I join all the coding in an interactive environment using shinyApp.
The environment allows you to input diferent start and end dates, as well as the ticker you want, as long as it
is available in Yahoo Finance. When you press **RUN** it stores the data in the "DATA" tab.
The "Plot" tab as itÂ´s name suggest is the candle, with the option to reduce the time scope and hover over to show the prices.
At the bottom there is a list of inidcators to choose, then when tou press **START INDICATORS** the plot changes, 
if you remove the selection the plot also refreshes itself and the indicator desappears.
The interactivity of narrowing the data range remains.
