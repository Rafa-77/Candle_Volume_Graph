# Candle_Volume_Graph
Make a interactive candle and volumne graph in R

This project uses a linear database.
And a financial graph is made, where one can enter the information from Yahoo Finance 
of any stock or index and obtain a candlestick graph reflecting the prices. 
Where if you hover over the graph, you will be able to see the price.

Also a volume graph. Where if you hover over the graph, you will be able to see the volume.

So that in the end I attach both graphs in one.
